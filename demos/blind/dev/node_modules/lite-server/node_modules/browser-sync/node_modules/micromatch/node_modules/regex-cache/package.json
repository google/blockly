Regardless of how big or small the regex is, when zero options are passed, caching will be faster than not.\n* **A few options are passed**, and the values are primitives. The limited benchmarks I did show that caching is beneficial when up to 8 or 9 options are passed.\n\n### Do not use this when...\n\n* **The values of options are not primitives**. When non-primitives must be compared for equality, the time to compare the options is most likely as long or longer than the time to just create a new regex.\n\n\n### Example benchmarks\n\nPerformance results, with and without regex-cache:\n\n```bash\n# no args passed (defaults)\n  with-cache x 8,699,231 ops/sec ±0.86% (93 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 2,777,551 ops/sec ±0.63% (95 runs sampled)\n\n# string and six options passed\n  with-cache x 1,885,934 ops/sec ±0.80% (93 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 1,256,893 ops/sec ±0.65% (97 runs sampled)\n\n# string only\n  with-cache x 7,723,256 ops/sec ±0.87% (92 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 2,303,060 ops/sec ±0.47% (99 runs sampled)\n\n# one option passed\n  with-cache x 4,179,877 ops/sec ±0.53% (100 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 2,198,422 ops/sec ±0.47% (95 runs sampled)\n\n# two options passed\n  with-cache x 3,256,222 ops/sec ±0.51% (99 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 2,121,401 ops/sec ±0.79% (97 runs sampled)\n\n# six options passed\n  with-cache x 1,816,018 ops/sec ±1.08% (96 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 1,157,176 ops/sec ±0.53% (100 runs sampled)\n\n# \n# diminishing returns happen about here\n# \n\n# ten options passed\n  with-cache x 1,210,598 ops/sec ±0.56% (92 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 1,665,588 ops/sec ±1.07% (100 runs sampled)\n\n# twelve options passed\n  with-cache x 1,042,096 ops/sec ±0.68% (92 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 1,389,414 ops/sec ±0.68% (97 runs sampled)\n\n# twenty options passed\n  with-cache x 661,125 ops/sec ±0.80% (93 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 1,208,757 ops/sec ±0.65% (97 runs sampled)\n\n# \n# when non-primitive values are compared\n# \n\n# single value on the options is an object\n  with-cache x 1,398,313 ops/sec ±1.05% (95 runs sampled)\n  without-cache x 2,228,281 ops/sec ±0.56% (99 runs sampled)\n```\n\n## Run benchmarks\n\nInstall dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -d && npm run benchmarks\n```\n\n\n## What this does\n\nIf you're using `new RegExp('foo')` instead of a regex literal, it's probably because you need to dyamically generate a regex based on user options or some other potentially changing factors. \n\nWhen your function creates a string based on user inputs and passes it to the `RegExp` constructor, regex-cache caches the results. The next time the function is called if the key of a cached regex matches the user input (or no input was given), the cached regex is returned, avoiding unnecessary runtime compilation.\n\nUsing the RegExp constructor offers a lot of flexibility, but the runtime compilation comes at a price - it's slow. Not specifically because of the call to the RegExp constructor, but **because you have to build up the string before `new RegExp()` is even called**.\n\n\n## Run tests\n\nInstall dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -d && npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
