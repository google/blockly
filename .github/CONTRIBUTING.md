# Contributing to Blockly

Want to contribute? Great!

- First, read this page (including the small print at the end).
- Second, please make pull requests against develop, not master. If your patch
  needs to go into master immediately, include a note in your PR.

For more information on style guide and other details, head over to the [Blockly Developers site](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/modify/contributing).

### Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

### Larger changes

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

### Browser compatibility

We care strongly about making Blockly work on all browsers. As of 2022 we
support Edge, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. We will not accept changes that only
work on a subset of those browsers. You can check [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/)
for compatibility information.

### The small print

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the
[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).
