   * style changed depending on its current focus state (i.e. blurred, actively
   * focused, and passively focused). The element will have one of two styles
   * attached (where no style indicates blurred/not focused):
   * - blocklyActiveFocus
   * - blocklyPassiveFocus
   *
   * The returned element must also have a valid ID specified, and unique to the
   * element relative to its nearest IFocusableTree parent. It must also have a
   * negative tabindex (since the focus manager itself will manage its tab index
   * and a tab index must be present in order for the element to be focusable in
   * the DOM).
   *
   * The returned element must be visible if the node is ever focused via
   * FocusManager.focusNode() or FocusManager.focusTree(). It's allowed for an
   * element to be hidden until onNodeFocus() is called, or become hidden with a
   * call to onNodeBlur().
   *
   * It's expected the actual returned element will not change for the lifetime
   * of the node (that is, its properties can change but a new element should
   * never be returned).
