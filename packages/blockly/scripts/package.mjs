 * support it in certain circumstances (e.g., when using webpack's
 * resolve.alias configuration option to alias 'blockly' to
 * 'node_modules/blockly', as we formerly did in most plugins, which
 * causes webpack to ignore blockly's package.json entirely).
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - Such bundlers will _completely_ ignore the exports declaration.
 * - The bundles are intended to be used in a browser—or at least not
 *   in node.js—so the core entrypoint never needs to route to
 *   core-node.js.  This is reasonable since there's little reason to
 *   bundle code for node.js, and node.js has supported the exports
 *   clause since at least v12, consideably older than any version of
 *   node.js we officially support.
 * - It suffices to provide only a CJS entrypoint (because we can only
 *   provide CJS or ESM, not both.  (We could in future switch to
 *   providing only an ESM entrypoint instead, though.)
