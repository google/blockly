# Usage: local_build.sh.
#
# This script generates only local_blockly_compressed.js and
# local_blocks_compressed.js . You may modify it as needed to build other
# files.
#
# local_blockly_compressed.js:
# The compressed file is a concatenation of all of Blockly's core files, run
# through a local copy of Google's Closure Compiler with simple optimizations
# turned on.
#
# local_blocks_compressed.js:
# The compressed file is a concatenation of all of Blockly's block files, run
# through a local copy of Google's Closure Compiler with simple optimizations
# turned on.
#

# Future work:
# - Trim down Google's Apache licenses, to match the output of build.py.
# - Generate other compressed files generated by build.py normally.
# - Add a good error message if multiple versions of the closure compiler were
#   found.
