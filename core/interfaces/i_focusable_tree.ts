 * Represents a tree of focusable elements with its own active/passive focus
 * context.
 *
 * Note that focus is handled by FocusManager, and tree implementations can have
 * at most one IFocusableNode focused at one time. If the tree itself has focus,
 * then the tree's focused node is considered 'active' ('passive' if another
 * tree has focus).
 *
 * Focus is shared between one or more trees, where each tree can have exactly
 * one active or passive node (and only one active node can exist on the whole
 * page at any given time). The idea of passive focus is to provide context to
 * users on where their focus will be restored upon navigating back to a
 * previously focused tree.
 *
 * Note that if the tree's current focused node (passive or active) is needed,
 * FocusableTreeTraverser.findFocusedNode can be used.
 *
 * Note that if specific nodes are needed to be retrieved for this tree, either
 * use lookUpFocusableNode or FocusableTreeTraverser.findFocusableNodeFor.
