   * manually changed to an element outside of the ephemeral UI, the UI should

   *
   * Important details regarding the onFocusChangedInDom callback:
   * - This method will be called initially with a value of 'true' indicating
   *   that the ephemeral element has been focused, so callers can rely on that,

   * - It's safe to end ephemeral focus in this callback (and is encouraged for
   *   callers that wish to automatically end ephemeral focus when the user
   *   directs focus outside of the element).
   * - The element AND all of its descendants are tracked for focus. That means
   *   the callback will ONLY be called with a value of 'false' if focus
   *   completely leaves the DOM tree for the provided focusable element.
   * - It's invalid to return focus on the very first call to the callback,
   *   however this is expected to be impossible, anyway, since this method
   *   won't return until after the first call to the callback (thus there will
   *   be no means to return ephemeral focus).
   *
   * @param focusableElement The element that should be focused until returned.
   * @param onFocusChangedInDom An optional callback which will be notified
   *     whenever the provided element's focus changes before ephemeral focus is
   *     returned. See the details above for specifics.
